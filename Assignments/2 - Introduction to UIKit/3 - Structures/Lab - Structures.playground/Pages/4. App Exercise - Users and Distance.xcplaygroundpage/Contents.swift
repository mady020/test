## App Exercise - Users and Distance
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 For most apps you'll need to have a data structure to hold information about a user. Create a `User` struct that has properties for basic information about a user. At a minimum, it should have properties to represent a user's name, age, height, weight, and activity level. You could do this by having `name` be a `String`, `age` be an `Int`, `height` and `weight` be of type `Double`, and `activityLevel` be an `Int` that will represent a scoring 1-10 of how active they are. Implement this now.
 */
struct User{
    var name:String
    var age:Int
    var height:Double
    var weight:Double
    var activityLevel:Int
}
//:  Create a variable instance of `User` and call it your name. Use the memberwise initializer to pass in information about yourself. Then print out a description of your `User` instance using the instance's properties.
var madhav:User = User(name: "Madhav", age: 20, height: 6.4, weight: 81, activityLevel: 4)
print("Name          : \(madhav.name)")
print("Age           : \(madhav.age)")
print("Height        : \(madhav.height)")
print("Weight        : \(madhav.weight)")
print("Activity Level: \(madhav.activityLevel)")

 In previous app exercises, you've worked with distance in the fitness tracking app example as a simple number. However, distance can be represented using a variety of units of measurement. Create a `Distance` struct that will represent distance in various units of measurement. At a minimum, it should have a `meters` property and a `feet` property. Create a custom initializer corresponding to each property (i.e. if you only have the two properties for meters and feet you will then have two initializers) that will take in a distance in one unit of measurement and assign the correct value to both units of measurements. Hint: *1 meter = 3.28084 feet*.

 - Example: If you use the initializer for meters and pass in a distance of 1600, the initializer should set `meters` to 1600 and `feet` to 5249.344.
 */
struct Distance{
    var meters:Double
    var feet:Double
    
    init(m distanceInMeters:Double){
        self.meters = distanceInMeters
        self.feet = distanceInMeters * 3.28084
    }
    init(f distanceInFeet:Double){
        self.feet = distanceInFeet
        self.meters = self.feet / 3.28084
    }
}

//:  Now create an instance of `Distance` called `mile`. Use the initializer for meters to set the distance to 1600. Print out the property for feet and verify that it is equal to 5249.344.
var mile:Distance = Distance(m: 1600)
print("Distance in Meters:",mile.meters)
print("Distance in Feet  :",mile.feet)
//:  Now create another instance of `Distance` and give it some other distance. Ensure that both properties are set correctly.
var someDistance:Distance = Distance(f: 5249.344)
print("Distance in Meters:",someDistance.meters)
print("Distance in Feet  :",someDistance.feet)
